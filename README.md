# Youtube-grabber
YouTube is the most-watched video
streaming website. Launched in 2005,
the online video platform features a wide
variety of content, including TV clips,
educational videos, music & gaming
videos, entertainment stuff, and much
more.
A slow internet connection can create
problems while streaming videos online.
But with a YouTube video downloader, it
helps us to download YouTube videos in
both video and audio formats. Using this
downloader we can save these video
and audio files directly to our gallery[Alan pps project.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19103244/Alan.pps.project.pdf)
